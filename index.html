Message:

Hi, Speed. My name is Frankie. I'm a huge fan of Minecraft, and I've been playing for about two years now. Every day after school, me and my friend, John would always play on his private server. He was a bit of a noob at Minecraft, but since he was pretty rich, he decided to buy a private server so we could play multiplayer survival, along with my friends, Vincent and Brady.

One day, we all were in a group Skype chat and we were working on a huge survival city that we were in the process of building for at least 8 months. We were really proud with how it turned out. It was located in a desert, so we appropriately named our city “Drybones.” All of a sudden, while we all went to grab supplies to finish the hotel that we were working on, John noticed something strange in the chat. The only plugins that we had on the server were Essentials, along with some plugin that Brady found called “SocialSpy.” Thanks to SocialSpy, it seems that someone named “player.number:303” used the command “/stop.” Now, John suffers from major anxiety. I’ve known him since preschool, and he’s always been a really insecure person, so when he saw that a so-called “nonexistent player” tried to shut down the server, he immediately thought that it was a hacker. At first, I thought it was just a bug or something and that he was being paranoid, but I reminded myself that this was a private server. I set up the plugins for him and such, and I kept his server whitelisted, since he didn’t know how. There was no way anyone could join except us.

I checked the server control panel, and it showed we were the only ones on the server. I was getting a bit confused. We all decided to just ignore it and continue on with our survival. It’s about 20 minutes in, and I’m walking with Vincent to the nearest forest to grab wood, which wasn’t very near at all. All of a sudden, we see a white figure in the distance of the desert. It appeared to be in the model of some type of ghostly figure, with what I could barely make out as red eyes. I quickly took a screenshot and ran after it.

For some reason, Vincent’s player just stood still. I assume it’s just lag, but he’s not even speaking on the skype call. I check skype and ask if he’s still online. No answer. He’s not even on the Skype call. By now, Brady is just ignoring us and concentrating on the hotel, and John is freaking out. I can hear the shakiness of his voice. Anyhow, I open up Minecraft again to see that the white figure disappeared, and Vincent disconnected from the server. I try calling him on my phone, but no answer. It goes straight to voice mail. I try texting him, but the texts don’t deliver.  John’s getting worried, to the point where it sounds like he’s about to cry. Brady isn’t even listening to us, he’s not aware of the situation at all. I finally get his attention, and he finally realizes how peculiar this problem is. He tps to me and helps me search for the white figure. Now, John’s hysterically crying, thinking that the hacker killed Vincent IRL or something.
Suddenly, my screen starts glitching. It’s not normal for Minecraft to bug out like that. It looked like it was corrupted or something. If that’s not bad enough, the chat starts spamming “Object successfully summoned” by “player.number:303.” I look at the skype chat, and realize that someone has joined the call. It does not have a username, nor did we get any notification of someone getting added to the call. John’s just watching this all happen. His voice is shaking, and I can hear him sniffling. Honestly, I was starting to get a little freaked out myself. Brady seemed to leave the call and disconnect from the server, possibly out of boredom. I’m trying to calm John down, but he simply repeats “I CAN’T TAKE THIS. THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR ME.”

The anonymous skype caller finally puts facecam on. It’s too dark to see anything. John gets too overwhelmed and leaves the call and server. I don’t blame him, if he stayed any longer, he’d probably have a mental breakdown. It’s just me and this anonymous player. I ask if there’s anyone there. I hear a faint voice saying something like “MAKE A WISH.” It was faint, yet it sounded like a voice changer. I decide to switch on Minecraft to see if the player is there. The chat spams with “FILE OVERLOAD” in red text, along with “MAKE A WISH” in gray text. I suddenly get poisoned with a potion of blindness. I then lose my ability to move. I can’t even turn off my computer or exit out of Minecraft. This player then runs up to me. It seemed to have a ghostly skin on, with red eyes and a white parka. The chat then says one more thing. “Make a wish, and say goodbye to your friends.” The skype call drops and somehow exits out by itself, and the player runs up to me and hits me. For some reason, it makes that “oof” noise that used to exist in Beta and earlier. My computer then shuts off. I try to turn it on, but to no avail. I try using my phone, but the internet is down.

I wait about three hours before turning on my computer. The desktop wallpaper was changed to green coding, probably hex. I then realize that literally everything except the Recycling Bin was deleted from my PC. I turn off my computer and use my laptop. I try calling John, but he doesn’t answer. The same goes with Brady and Vincent. I decide to just go to bed and go to school the next day to speak with John and the others the next day. I go to school the next morning, and Brady is the only one to show up. He says that Vin and John’s parents called his parents and ask if John or Vin are at his house. Apparently, they went missing. There was no sign of them, and the police came to their houses and check to see if they were any clues on where they were, but there were no results. I decide to ditch school and walk to John’s house to see if he’s there. I see his mother sitting on the steps, crying. I ask if she’s ok, and she says that Jhon might be dead Not in the house, most likely snuck out to end his life. She handed me a piece of paper that she claimed to have been left on John’s computer table. I read the note carefully. “I can’t take this anymore. I can’t sleep, I’m afraid he’s watching me. I can’t live like this knowing that someone is after me, wanting me to die a slow, painful death. I’m sorry mom……I love you.” I started to cry a bit when I read those last few words. I check the back of the paper, and written on the corner in very small text was that familiar phrase……”MAKE A WISH.”

After about 20 minutes of comforting John’s mother, I leave to go check on Vincent. His dad’s car is in the driveway, but no one is home. Not even his dad. I sneak in the house, and what do I see in the bathroom? Written on the mirror in red marker are the words “MAKE A WISH.” That was when I realized that these weren’t just coincidences. This was a serious issue. Not just some hacker, but someone who is mentally torturing his victims and causing them to so-called “disappear.”

If you get this email, Speed, and if you ever encounter “303” again, I want you to quickly close out of your Minecraft and shut down your computer. I don’t want you to end up like Vincent or John. Please be careful……if I get

more information, I’ll contact you immediately. Good luck.<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph_scey_xhY&ab_channel=RejectedShotgun">303 VIDEO</A>

    <h1>GIANT STEVE</h1>
    <H4> November 19 - 20 2021
        I just got home from school and loaded the Minecraft program. I created a new survival world and I had typed in a random seed. The new Minecraft world had loaded up and I spawned in the middle of a acacia biome surrounded by oak and swamp biomes. I started collecting wood and making space to build my house. I built my house out of acacia planks. I later made tools and got glass for my windows. I found a village which was already looted. I thought I was in a lucky seed. As it started raining, I traveled back to my house to go to my mineshaft. I had found diamonds. I then went home to craft them into tools and armour. As I finished crafting them, I heard a loud scream. Not in my real life house but from my computer. I didn't know there was screaming in Minecraft. I went out to investigate. I saw the village was destroyed and on fire. Strangely, there were no sources that could have caused the fire. I went into the village. There was redstone on the ground and zombie flesh everywhere although my gamemode was on peaceful. When I picked up the zombie flesh, it was renamed to "HUMAN FLESH" I got scared and ran home. When I arrived at my house, It was already night time. On the chat, it said "Giant Steve set the time to midnight". 'Who is Giant Steve?' I asked myself. I looked up Giant Steve on Google. The only results I saw was a statue of the Steve skin in Minecraft. But if there was a pre-built statue in this world, how can it change the time or interact with commands? I asked myself. I peered through the window and saw Giant Steve lurking in the distance. He had hollow eye-sockets and half of his left eye was missing, blood covered his mangled skin. His skin did not appear on the Google image search results. I already knew about Giant Alex. But he seemed more harmful than Giant Alex. The second time I looked out of the window, he was gone. Because it was midnight in my world, I went to sleep. The next morning in my Minecraft world, I had started seeing footprints that were slightly bigger than Giant Alex. In real life, I had to go to bed. I saved the world and hit the sack. The next day, it was the weekend. I ate breakfast, switched my computer on and loaded the Minecraft program. I loaded the world I saw Giant Steve in. I spawned in a cave, and all my items were gone. I looked up and saw Giant Steve. The Minecraft program crashed. I loaded up Minecraft again and I was signed out of my Microsoft Account. I emailed Microsoft Studios to inform them that I was hacked. I didn't get an email from them until the first day of the school holidays. I got an Email from Microsoft Studios. They had recovered my account. I logged in and my Minecraft saves were corrupted. My user was a long string of characters I had never seen . After a while, my account became useless. I made a new one, then emailed Mojang Studios to restore my saves from my old Microsoft Account and migrate it to my new. They did it straight away. After then, I just got on with my life and didn't see Giant Steve again. - Original author unknown</H4>

            <H1>HEROBRINE</H1>
            <H4>On July 31, 2010, Minecraft Forum user Flaky posted a comment, supposedly copied from a post on 4chan's /v/ board, containing a story of a player encountering an entity with glowing white eyes after listening to the "13" music disc.[1] One supposed instance of these eyes was linked in the comment, being a YouTube upload of "13" posted the previous day (the same day that the disc was added to the game), where a screenshot of a dark cave with two white eyes can be seen.[2] This story is the first known instance of the concept of a creepypasta regarding a white-eyed paranormal being in Minecraft.

                The following day, Forum user Endorphine posted a thread recounting a myth surrounding the ambient sounds added to caves in Alpha v1.0.3, in which "a pair of white pixels" would appear whenever these sounds would play.[3] The same video was linked as an example of an appearance of these white pixels. The phenomenon was attributed to "White Eyes", a female creature who would stalk the player from afar with no visible traits other than her blank white eyes.[4]
                
                Herobrine creepypasta
                The "White Eyes" story began spreading through the Minecraft Forum, either stemming from or being popularized by the aforementioned thread. On August 24, a modified version of the story appeared: "White Eyes" was now a default player model with whited out eyes.[5] At some point before August 19,[6] a similar altered version of the story surfaced: "White Eyes" gained the name "Herobrine" and was now described as the deceased brother of Notch (in reality, Notch has never had a brother[7]), taking the form of a human entity with white eyes. The exact origin of this version of the story is unknown, with the earliest known instances of it being from a comment in a Minecraft Forum thread on August 30, 2010,[8] and a now-deleted image posted on 4chan's paranormal /x/ board on August 31.[9] The story details an encounter in Minecraft with a nameless human entity in a single-player world who displayed strange behavior such as stalking the player from afar, creating unnatural constructions such as sand pyramids in the ocean and long 2x2 tunnels, and removing leaves from trees. The writer then attempted to start a topic about the encounter on the Minecraft Forum, only to have it be repeatedly deleted, followed by a private message from a seemingly nonexistent user named "Herobrine" telling them to stop. The 4chan post also contained a screenshot of the encounter, showing Herobrine in the distance amidst the fog.
                
                Brocraft streams
                Brocraft streamer Copeland came across the Herobrine story on 4chan's /v/ board and took a liking to it. He edited Herobrine into several screenshots to show to his chat and, after getting largely good reactions, decided to stage a hoax; he changed the texture of a painting to display Herobrine and put it in a work-in-progress house in his world, planning to show it on a livestream. On August 30, Copeland played through the world as a normal player would, deliberately avoiding the work-in-progress room he had set up for the hoax, until about 20 minutes and 45 seconds in, when he entered the house and saw the re-textured painting. Copeland then screamed and ran out of the room, promptly ending the stream. He pretended to be shaken up in the chat and later posted a message onto the forums, linking to the video to spread it around in the hopes of getting similar reactions.[10] Other users in the thread began debating whether Copeland's sighting was real and started posting their own screenshots with Herobrine edited into them.[11] After a while, Copeland removed the painting and reverted to normal textures, then proceeded to stream further, pretending to be scared. He announced that he would delete the world to never meet Herobrine again.</H4>

                <H1>VLL R</H1>
                <H4>So, my friend and I decided to play together on the server that I had created, so we did just that. Beforehand, I had changed the game mode to 0, because we wanted to do a full-on survival world. So, I made up the world and we began playing.

                    Considering this was 5 years ago, I don't remember what seed I put in, but whatever it was, it included a village right near the spawn area. But, anyway, back to the story. It was a pretty normal gameplay that we had. Get wood, craft mandatory items, get stone, craft furnace, build a house, etc. But it was at one point when we were walking to the house because it was getting dark, that the time suddenly changed to day. My friend thought I was messing with code and stuff like that. But I assured him I didn't even get out of my Minecraft window at any point or time.
                    
                    I checked the logs to see who did it, because I was the only administrator. And this is what I saw:
                    
                    <vllr has changed the time to 10000> or something like that. I was shook, and I told my friend what I had seen. He still wasn't buying it. I was just trying to figure out who in the world Vllr was. It was only me and my friend in the game, so There was no possible way that another player could be in the game. Then it hit me. If it wasn't a player, it was another entity. I quickly tell my friend my thoughts, and he agreed. So, I typed in chat:
                    
                    <ItzDJCrafter66: Who is vllr?>. Not expecting an answer, I continued to keep playing. But then, out of nowhere, another message pops up: <vllr: vllr obxiiv txkq ql hklt?>. This sent a chill down my spine, I was officially scared and confused. I assumed he was talking in Swedish, (cause Herobrine and stuff) so I translated it from English to Swedish. It didn't work, but something popped up under the translator which said: Translate from: Bulgarian. At this point I was curious so I clicked on it, and this is what it said:
                    
                    Do you have a drink? Now, that sounded really weird, why would an entity be asking me if I have a drink. So I asked: <ItzDJCrafter66: Why would I have a drink?> and then Vllr responded in under 2 seconds at maximum: <vllr: F afaq?>. So again, I translated from Bulgarian to English and it didn't work. So at this point I knew that he probably wasn't speaking in Swedish, English or Bulgarian. My friend asked him <DogDude2005: What language are you speaking?>. I thought that was a really reasonable question to ask. Then again, Vllr responds in under 2 seconds <vllr: three letters back.>. I thought, three letters back? Then I started to translate the text's he wrote before. Just as I was doing so however, the chat comes up with:
                    
                    <vllr Teleported: DogDude2005 to vllr>. He had teleported my friend to him. My friend suddenly started rapidly messaging me saying: "DUDE! DUDE! VLLR IS A VILLAGER! HE LOOKS LIKE A VILLAGER BUT WITH WHITE PUPILS AND BLACK EYES! HE IS IN ONE OF THE HOUSES AT THE VILLAGE! AH." Then I looked back on my Minecraft screen and saw this in the chat:
                    
                    <vllr has banned DogDude2005 from the game>
                    
                    <DogDude2005 has left the game>
                    
                    Then Vllr teleported me to him, and this is what I saw:
                    
                    
        
                    
                    I couldn't move my player, it was stuck in one position, staring at the entity. Then, my screen went black, and then blue, then finally ending on the Minecraft screen. It had crashed my game. I went to saves so I could delete the world but, it was already erased from the saves folder. I haven't seen this entity since...</H4>
